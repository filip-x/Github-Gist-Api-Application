# Github-Gist-Api-Application
I am using the Api provided by Github Gist Api to create a basic singlel-page application. The goal of this application is to allow the users to enter a username and get the full list of public Gists for that user.
Using the search bar you can search for a github user and retrive a list of their gists.
For each gist you are able to see what files are included and their types and also the last 3 people who forked the gists. 
By clicking on the file name you will be able to see the content of the file.
